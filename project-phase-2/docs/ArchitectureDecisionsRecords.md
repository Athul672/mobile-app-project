 

Development Framework – React Native 

Status 

Accepted 

Decision 

We will develop a mobile weather application using React Native. 

Context 

We are creating a weather app for Android. Our team already has experience with JavaScript, React, and Expo from previous SAIT courses. Because React Native also uses JavaScript, the team can build the app more quickly without learning a completely new framework. This helps us stay productive and meet the project timeline. 

Options Considered 

    React Native 

    Ionic 

    Cordova 

    Native Script 

    Framework7 

 

Rationale 

React Native is a strong choice for a weather app because it allows fast development and provides smooth performance like native Android apps. It supports essential weather app features like GPS for location, API requests for weather data, and animated UI components for weather visuals. 
 React Native also has a large ecosystem of libraries such as Expo, which makes it easier to handle permissions, fetch API data, and design UI screens. Many online tutorials and community resources are available, making this a convenient choice. 

Consequences  

    We can build the weather app faster because we already know JavaScript and React. 

    It is easy to use GPS and location services, which are important for showing local weather. 

    Many libraries help us fetch real-time weather data from APIs. 

    Lots of tutorials and community support make building weather features easier. 

    Some advanced Android features might need extra setup, but they are not required for our weather app. 

 

 

 

    Navigation strategy 

 

    Hardware: GPS, Speaker, Fingerprint scanner, etc.  

Our weather app will not use any device hardware. 

Context 

The weather app only needs to show weather information from an online API. It does not need the camera, microphone, GPS, or any other hardware to work. Keeping the app simple helps us finish it faster. 

Options Considered 

    Use GPS 

    Use sensors 

    Use camera or microphone 

    Use no hardware (chosen) 

Rationale 

We are not using hardware because: 

    The app works well without it. 

    It keeps the project easy and simple. 

    No permission is needed. 

    Faster development and fewer errors. 

Consequences 

 Easy to build 
  No need to ask for permissions 
  Fewer problems and faster testing 
  Users must type in the location instead of it being detected automatically 

 

 

 

    Database storage: Local (encrypted or unencrypted), remote, or none.  

Status 

Decided not to use database storage. Open to using database storage if 100% needed. 

Decision 

Decided not to use database storage for our mobile weather app. 

Assumptions 

We want to make an app that will show the current temperature and a 5-day forecast. 

    All of the information will be displayed on the same page.
